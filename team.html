                    <div class="member-bio">Jake Gluck is the Founder and CEO of Fortune Capital. 5 years ago, he saw a need in the market for honest and creative brokers, and built Fortune Capital with that in mind. He is a deal maker, who has committed to never allowing a massive problem hinder a closing. Through a creative mind, a dedication to transparency with both clients and lenders, he has found a niche in getting some of the most complex transactions across the finish line.

 

                        Beginning his career at Eastern Union Funding, Jake ran the banking relationship department, sourcing new banking relationships, and finding creative lenders for deals that didnâ€™t have a traditional home. His warm personality and personal touch led to billions of dollars in closings for the firm.
                        
                         
                        
                        Jake studied in some of the top Yeshivas over a 20 year period, and continues to contribute to his community. Outside of his professional career he is an all star defensive lineman in the DFL, and loves to spend time with his two daughters.</div>
